* Data Science applied to environmental indicators


Some basic indicators from Mexico can be found at: [[https://datos.gob.mx/busca/organization/semarnat

I also made my own CSV based on a world bank dataset (any of them are very useful, so I have to clean the data and complete missing values if possible)
