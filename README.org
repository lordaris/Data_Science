I also made my own CSV based on a world bank dataset (any of them are very useful, so I have to clean the data and complete missing values if possible) 
World bank dataset: https://data.humdata.org/dataset/world-bank-environment-indicators-for-mexico
My own dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessarmandopealucero/mexico-environmental-indicators

My first approach to Data science and environmental indicators from Mexico is here: https://github.com/lordaris/Data_Science/blob/main/Environmental_Indicators_Mexico.ipynb
